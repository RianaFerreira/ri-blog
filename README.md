# MY BLOG

If you have ever wondered what it would be like to wipe the slate clean and start a journey into a new career path? I'll be blogging about where I came from, making the most of my life, the work I do and how it's all working out.

From Business Analyst to Junior Developer, I'm loving every minute!
